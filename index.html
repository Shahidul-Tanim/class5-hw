    <p>The Players' Tribune is a new media platform that produces daily sports conversation and publishes first-person stories from professional athletes.
       The platform was founded by former professional Major League Baseball player Derek Jeter in 2014. Content ranges from videos to podcasts to player polls and written pieces...

    <h4>History</h4>
    <p>The Players' Tribune launched in October 2014 by Derek Jeter and Jaymee Messler, the chief marketing officer of Excel Sports Management,
       Jeter's agency, as a means for athletes to offer more direct insight into their lives.[2][3] The outlet began collecting venture capital
       funds in 2015 and entered a "next phase" which included expanding content from the written word to include podcasts, video, and
       a presence on SiriusXM satellite radio.[3] The same year, The Players' Tribune launched TPT Assist, a cause-related platform designed to
       allow athletes to share their philanthropic endeavors.[4]

    <p class="para_one">Messler served as the president of The Players' Tribune until leaving in January 2019.[5] In June 2017, Jeff Levick, former Spotif
       Chief Revenue Officer, was named the first CEO of the company.[6] Legendary Entertainment supplied funding as well as creative support
       .[7][8] On June 15, 2015, it was announced that New Enterprise Associates, a venture capital firm, had invested $9.5M in The Players' Tribune.
       [9] Among the attractions for the firm was the athlete ownership of the site and athlete involvement.[10] As of October 27, 2015, after the 
       Series B first close of $9.5 million, another $5.5 million in equities was made available to additional investors. Kobe Bryant, who had been
       involved with TPT since December 2014, made the largest investment in the platform and led all athletes in the round.[11] Athletes represented
       by GenTrust, an investment management company, were among the athletes who invested.[12]

    <p id="siu">
        The platform's content includes first-person written stories, videos, podcasts, and photo galleries. Topics covered by the platform
        include mental health, athlete retirements, social justice issues, and more.[19][3]
    </p>
    <p class="para_one"> The content is produced in partnership between the athlete and the outlet's editorial team, with close oversight by
                         the athlete. The vast majority of articles are written by staff at The Players' Tribune, who craft stories based on
                         interviews conducted with the athletes. All content is approved by the athletes before it is posted, with some 
                         exercising greater control over the finished product than others.[19][20] The site's former editorial director, 
                         Gary Hoenig, noted the stories are largely crafted from "monologues, with questions to nudge the conversation along,
                         " rather than a traditional interview.[19]</p>
